					<p>Every year Botany Downs Secondary College offers three college wide events 
					that every student is expected to compete in. These events are Athletics, 
					Swimming Sports and Cross Country. All three events are held in the first half 
					of the year. Students that excel in any of these three events have the opportunity 
					to represent their college at the regional and national events.

					<p>Our Annual Sports Awards dinner is held later in the year. This is a great opportunity for the sports

					teams.

					<p>Picnic day is a fun event held for just year 9 and 10 students in the last week of college.
