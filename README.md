# BDSC-Sports-Website
A website created in year 12 of highschool to demonstrate dynamic HTML and CSS knowledge, while also editing the media provided to me in Photoshop.

The website had to be dynamic in a way where the website should display correctly when resizing the window + on mobile devices.
Images had to also be edited in Photoshop from Athletics Day. In the images folder, I selected the images I wanted to have on my website and edited them. 
The edited images are located inside images/chosen_images.

All documentation and planning is under the planning folder.
